# Manal Gafoor's Portfolio Website
## _Using React and SASS_

[manalgafoor.com](https://manalgafoor.com)

This is a portfolio website built with create-react-app, showcasing my front end abilities. The project uses react-pageflip to for the page-turning effect of the books.

This portfolio works best on a laptop or a monitor. Though it is responsive, viewing it on smartphones mean the books are small to fit into screen, and hence the text will be slightly difficult to read. Hence, if you are on a smartphone, the website will redirect you to my Angular, mobile friendly page.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
